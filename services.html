            Here’s a closer look at the different ways North Star Planning Co can support
            you with Consumer Directed Community Supports (CDCS) in Minnesota.

          <article class="card">
            <div class="card-tag">01 &mdash; Getting started</div>
            <h2 class="card-title">New CDCS plan setup</h2>
            <p class="card-body">
              Support for participants and families who are new to CDCS or switching from
              traditional services. We talk through what CDCS is, what’s possible for you,
              and how to begin planning in a way that feels manageable.
            </p>
            <p class="card-body">
              We’ll cover what daily life looks like right now, what you’d like to be
              different, and how CDCS could help support those goals. You’ll leave with
              a clearer picture and next steps.

            <h2 class="card-title">Annual CDCS planning & updates</h2>
            <p class="card-body">
              Collaborative planning sessions to organize goals, supports, and your CDCS
              budget for the year. We help you think through options, keep track of
              details, and adjust the plan when needs change.
            </p>
            <p class="card-body">
              This can include reviewing what has been working well, what has been hard,
              and changes in needs or supports. We’ll make sure the plan reflects your
              current situation as closely as possible.

              Short, focused support throughout the year to answer questions, make
              small changes, or help you think through what’s next with your CDCS plan.
            </p>
            <p class="card-body">
              You can reach out when something shifts — a change in staffing, a new
              goal, or a new challenge — and we’ll look at how to reflect that in your
              plan and supports.
